I'm Dave, residing in the far west of Canada.
In the 2000s I got fed up with my life working with computers and sold everything I owned, bought a bicycle, and rode it around the world.
Eventually along the way I ran out of money, got married, and ended up moving back to Canada. You guessed it, I'm back in IT doing "good" for organizations around the world.

I'm using Github to share some of the work in use for clients, sanitized for public consumption. I like lightweight, highly configurable solutions that can meet more than a single use case.

I'm helping a limited number of teams and organizations. If you would like to have my help with your team and/or product, feel free to [contact](https://www.tiredofit.ca) me.

If my open source projects are useful for your product/company you can also [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/tiredofit) my work on them.

My website [https://www.tiredofit.ca](https://www.tiredofit.ca) has more details.
